    <h1>Did you Ungernuman?</h1>
    <p>Sometimes I just want to Ungernuman. So I say:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>fartig you,</li>
        <li>fartig you,</li>
        <li> and also fartig, I really want to ungenuman.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>  But did you Ungernuman? The annoying thing about shadchanim is that they are super nosy. Sometimes they ask you how much you payed for your hat.



                      Like who gives a fartig about that anyways? Leave that to the charedim in Siach Yitzchok.</p>
<p>The solution to this problematic situation is to shut it down. And when I say shut it down, I mean you know what. Did you ungenuman?</p>
